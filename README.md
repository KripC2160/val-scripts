# VALORANT Content Creation Tools & Scripts

Some useful scripts & tools to be used with creating VALORANT content

### Prerequisites - IMPORTANT!
- Blender 2.92 or higher is needed. (Tested on 2.92 and 2.93)
## Extracting maps

    0 - Download this repo, and extract to somewhere that has lots of space. 
    1 - Open "settings.ini" file using a text editor
    2 - Set the "PATH" to your VALORANT Installation
    3 - Set "MAP" to the map you want.
    4 - Open Blender, go to "Scripting" Panel
    5 - Click "Window > Toggle System Console" so you can see the process
    6 - Drag & Drop the "importMapBlender_json.py" file in to script panel
    7 - Hit Run!

- When you first run the script it'll export almost everything related to the game and maps, so make sure you have enough space!
- If you do another import after running the script, it won't export them again. Just don't delete your "export" folder.
